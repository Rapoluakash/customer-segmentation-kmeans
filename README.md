# K-Means Clustering Project

![K-Means Workflow](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using the **Mall_Customers** dataset.

---

## 📊 Project Summary

- 📁 Dataset: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- 📌 Features used: `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`
- 📈 Technique: **K-Means Clustering** (Unsupervised Machine Learning)
- 🧠 Optimal clusters found using the **Elbow Method**
- 📍 Visualizes customer clusters and their centroids
